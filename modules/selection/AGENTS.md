# Native module selection

selection is a native module of MyGo: Go interfaces implemented in Swift, Rust or
Zig. Read https://mygo.dev/docs/native-modules (docs/native-modules.md)
before changing it.

- `selection.go` declares the interfaces, the types they use and the errors
  (`native.NewError`): it is the contract. `//mygo:native` marks an entry point,
  which gets a constructor, `NewT`.
- `selection_native.go` and each language's generated file
  (`swift/Sources/Selection/Selection.mygo.swift`, `rust/src/mygo.rs`,
  `zig/src/mygo.zig`) are generated: never edit them; `mygo dev`
  regenerates them when the interfaces change.
- `swift/` is a Swift package, which macOS uses when it is there, for
  Apple's frameworks: a factory `makeT()` per entry point and classes
  conforming to the generated protocols. Add Swift packages and frameworks
  in `swift/Package.swift`.
- `rust/` is a Rust crate and `zig/` a Zig package, for every platform: a
  factory per entry point (`make_t` in Rust, `makeT` in Zig) and types
  implementing the generated traits or declarations.

Check the module without opening the app:

```sh
mygo native check            # generate, build and vet: every problem as file:line
mygo native call Greeter.Greet '{"name": "Ada"}'   # call a method, print its result
```
